Q & A
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - So that you can work with others and keep a copy of the file

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  - Because you might not want the changes from remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
  - Forks: Use to clone a repository from another github account to your account.
  - Clones: Use to clone repository from remote to local working directory.
  - Branches: Create to work on a new function, or experiment.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  － Push new changes will be a lot easier later
  

Git concept
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Forking a repository: Similar to Clone.
                      Clone a repository from another github account to your account.

Fast-Forward merge(git pull): when branch A can be reached from branch B.
                              The change will not create a new commit.
                              Instead, it will update the tip commit

Git commands
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
git pull (remote_name) (local_branch_name): pull data from github and merge
  - equal to git fetch followed by git merge

git fetch origin: pull data from github
