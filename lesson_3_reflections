When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- So that you can work with others and keep a copy of the file

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because you might not want the changes from remote

git pull (remote_name) (local_branch_name): pull data from github
