Q & A
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
How did viewing a diff between two versions of
a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
  - Because the things you changed could be the reason that causes bugs
  - like typo/resorce import


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
  - You can look through all the files that were created before.
  You can change anything and not worried about messing up the code.
  Easier for others to read, understand and help writing the code.


when to save?
  - At regular interval (eg: every hour) - I picked this one haha
  - whenever a large enough change is made (eg: 50 lines)
  - whenever there's a long pause in editing
  - when you choose to save


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved,
like Google Docs does
  - Manually choosing:
  Pros: You have full control of the files,
          know exactly what you did when you review it
  Cons: Sometimes forget to commit


Why do you think some version control systems,
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
  - Git is more programming related, for docs like articles, don't need to do
  multiple files together


It is possible to copy a directory from one computer to another using the command scp,
which stands for "secure copy". The name was chosen because the scp command
  - lets you securely copy a directory from one computer to another.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
  - Because you will be not worried about changes.
  you can always go back to the version before it breaks down.


Reflect: How Do You Want to Use Git?
  - For my projects, I can always look back to my files
  - For my design works


Version-control Concepts
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
- Manual saving
- DropBox
- Google docs
- Wikipedia
- Git
- SVN

- Entering commit IDs
If it is easier, you may enter the first four or more characters of the
commit ID rather than pasting the entire ID.


Git Errors and Warnings Solution
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
- Should not be doing an octopus
Octopus is a strategy Git uses to combine many different versions of code together.
This message can appear if you try to use this strategy in an inappropriate situation.

- You are in 'detached HEAD' state
HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. You can “detach” the HEAD
by switching to a previous commit, which we’ll see in the next video. Despite what it sounds like,
it’s actually not a bad thing to detach the HEAD. Git just warns you so that you’ll realize you’re doing it.

- Panic! (the 'impossible' happened)
This is a real error message, but it’s not output by Git. Instead it’s output by GHC,
the compiler for a programming language called Haskell. It’s reserved for particularly surprising errors!


Git commands
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
git diff: It takes two arguments - the two commit ids to compare.
          Compare two commits, printing each line that is present in one commit but not the other.


git clone: It takes one argument - the url of the repository to copy.
           Make a copy of an entire Git repository, including the history, onto your own computer.


git checkout: It takes one argument - the commit ID to restore.
              Temporarily reset all files in a directory to their state at the time of a specific commit.

git log: It doesn't take any arguments.
         Show the commits made in this repository, starting with the most recent.

git init: It doesn't take any arguments.
          This command creates an empty Git repository

git status: It doesn't take any arguments.
            Show the working tree status
